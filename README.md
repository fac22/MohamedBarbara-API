**This week we focus on setting up our repository** and next week we will focus on populating the page with data.

## User Stories

**_A [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/) is a description of one or more features of a piece of software._**

### Core Stories

**As a user, I want to:**

[ ] See an interesting mashup of different data
[ ] Input information to change the displayed result
[ ] View the app on all of my devices

### Stretch stories

[ ] As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading
[ ] As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong

### Acceptance Criteria

[ ] Query at least two APIs using `fetch`
[ ] Dynamic content generated with JS
[x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
[ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
[ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

## Planning

During the planning phase we suggest you spend time on:

[ ] Exploring APIs you are interested in working with
[ ] Considering your user journey
[ ] Deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting up the tasks
[ ] Estimate each user story with your partner and delegate the user stories between you
[ ] Set up the repository for your project and initialise your file structure

**Note: This week you are not expected to make any API calls.**

### Choosing your APIs

### Things to check before you start:

- Does it support CORS (cross-origin requests)?
- Is there a high enough rate limit?
- Is a free API key available?
- Are you able to use the API without user authentication (OAuth)?
- Is good documentation available?

Some APIs are badly documented or almost impossible to use. If you don’t manage to get a successful response within 20 minutes of reading their documentation we **strongly** recommend moving on to another one. This week is about practicing `fetch`, not using the coolest API.

### Recommended APIs

Here’s a list of decent APIs to consider. You can choose to use other APIs if you prefer, but make sure to do your research and check that what you want to do with the API is possible before you start to code.
